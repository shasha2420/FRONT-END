    <h3 id="1">Physics 101 :</h3>

    <p>The very first lesson to remember while driving is that roadways are full 
        of objects of unusual size and weight (mass) moving at high rates of speed 
        (acceleration). This can create tremendous forces, particularly in a crash. If 
        you took physics in high school, this is what your physics teacher tried to 
        teach you: 
        Force = Mass x Acceleration, or F = MA. </p>

        <p>Sound bites are one of the banes of modern life. This seems to be particularly 
            true when it comes to driving safety. You often hear news reports that claim 
            one cause for a crash, such as, “A driver, under the influence of alcohol, 
            hit a cyclist.” However, crashes themselves—and the degree to which those 
            involved are injured—are rarely the result of a single factor. Inevitably, there 
            are several contributing factors at play: the driver may have been using a 
            cell phone, the crash may have occurred at night, the cyclist may have been 
            wearing dark clothing with minimal or no reflectors, and/or the driver may 
            have had a blood alcohol content below the legal limit. These multiple factors are known as the interaction between causal (primary) and contributing 
            (secondary) factors.</p>

            <h3 id="3">SPEEDING KILLS:</h3>

            <p>Anyone who has studied driving safety for a long time will tell you the factors 
                that most often contribute to fatal crashes: booze, speed, and unused seat 
                belts. (More recently, driver distraction has been added to the list.) Here are 
                some facts to consider regarding speed. In general, speeding more than 10 
                mph over the speed limit or driving too fast for conditions increases your 
                odds of being in a crash by about 12 times (odds = 12.0).</p>

                <h3 id="4">Don’t Drive Too Fast—or Too Slow :</h3>

                <p>Your primary goal as a driver is to avoid conflicts with other vehicles. If you 
                    don’t have any conflicts—meaning, you don’t occupy the same space at the 
                    same time as other vehicles—you will never hit anyone else. The probability 
                    of a conflict increases under a variety of circumstances, including at intersections, where your path literally crosses the paths of other drivers; while 
                    changing lanes; and when there is a speed differential. As mentioned previously, both your crash risk and the resulting severity of the crash increase 
                    substantially when you speed. However, there is also greater risk of a crash 
                    if you travel at a significantly slower speed than other drivers. During both 
                    instances, you are creating what we call the speed differential, which results 
                    in a greater chance of a severe crash.</p>
